# clearnetwork
ClearNet is a consent-first, AI-augmented professional network that combines the best features of LinkedIn (profiles, opportunities) and Skool (learning, groups, community) while eliminating spam and attention-hijacking elements. The project is currently in the planning phase with some initial setup completed.
